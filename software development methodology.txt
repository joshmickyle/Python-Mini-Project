The software development methodology i chose was SCRUM. SCRUM is a agile technique.
The reason why i chose this technique was because of the sprints. SCRUM is modelled around
spliting the work up in sections and sprinting through the sections. After sprinting through a
section, a sprint review is held. The review is held to inspect the work. It also has daily plannings
where the days work is decided.

I chose SCRUM because i split the task into different sections then planned how i would code that specific
section. Once i was finished with each section i checked to see how each of them worked. I then created
an extra section to my code which joined all the other parts together at the bottom on the py file.

The advantage of this function was that i could adapt to any problems i encountered, which means flexibility is 
high in this technique.

The disadvantage was that my code had a lot of extra lines which wouldnt have to be their if i changed my methodology.
